= Page
include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

A page is a node in an xref:user-interface/outline.adoc[Outline].

In addition to the basic tree node attributes like `text`, `iconId` or `expanded`, it also has a detail content that is displayed in the bench of the desktop.

The content can either be a table or a form that will be shown when the page is selected.

There are two types of pages:

. Page with table
. Page with nodes

== Page with Table
The purpose of a page with table is to show tabular data when the page is selected.

Each row of the table can be linked to a sub-page so that double-clicking a row will select that sub-page.

== Page with Nodes
A page with nodes is mostly either used as a folder that contains sub-pages.
Or it is used to display detailed information about a specific table row of a page with table using a detail xref:user-interface/form.adoc[form].
