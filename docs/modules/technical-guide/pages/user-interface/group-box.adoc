= Group Box
include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

The purpose of a group box is to group multiple xref:user-interface/form-field.adoc[Form Fields].
Every xref:user-interface/form.adoc[Form] needs at least one group box which is the root group box (also known as main box).

In that root group box you can put as many form fields as you like.
You can also put another group box (or another composite field like a tab box) to create another group of fields.

== Arranging Fields
To arrange the fields inside a group box, the logical grid layout is used, which automatically layouts the elements based on their grid data hints.
This means every field is put into an invisible grid cell of the logical grid which has rows and columns.
The grid of the group box has 2 columns by default (`gridColumnCount`).
The width, height and gaps of the rows and columns are predefined, but could be adjusted if necessary (using `bodyLayoutConfig`).
With the grid data hints you can define the dimensions of a grid cell:

* `x` / `y` +
The position inside the grid. If set to -1, it will be calculated automatically by the logical grid based on the order of the fields. Using -1 (which is the default) is the preferred way, so in most cases you should not set the position explicitly.
* `w` / `h` +
  The logical size of the grid cell. E.g. if the grid has two columns, setting w to 2 will make the field span both columns.
  It is also used as min size if the grid cell should scale, see `weightX` / `weightY`.
* `weightX` / `weightY` +
Configures how much a grid cell should grow or shrink. +
  The value for this property can either be -1 or between 0 and 1.
** 0 means fixed size and the grid cell won't grow or shrink.
** Greater 0 means the grid cell will grab the excess space and therefore grow or shrink. If the container
contains more than one element with `weightX` resp. `weightY` > 0, the weight is used to specify how strong the size of the grid cell should be adjusted.
** -1 means the ui computes the optimal value so that the elements proportionally grab the excess space. +
* `useUiWidth` / `useUiHeight` +
  Configures whether the element should be as big as preferred by the UI.
  If the element has children, the preferred size normally is the computed size of the children. +
  This property typically has less priority than `widthInPixel` resp. `heightInPixel` and therefore only has an effect if no explicit size in pixel is set.
* `horizontalAlignment` / `verticalAlignment` +
  Configures the alignment of the element inside a grid cell, if `fillHorizontal` resp. `fillVertical` is set to false.
* `fillHorizontal` / `fillVertical` +
  Configures whether the element should fill the grid cell.
** If the property is set to true, the element takes all the space and therefore is as big as the grid cell.
** If it's set to false, the size is computed based on the properties `useUiWidth` resp. `useUiHeight` and `widthInPixel` resp. `heightInPixel`.
** If non of these are set, a default value is used which typically is the size of a logical grid column resp. logical grid row.
* `widthInPixel` / `heightInPixel` +
  Configures the preferred size of the element in pixel.
  If the value is less than or equal to 0 the property has no effect.

=== Example for WeightX
* A group box with 3 columns contains 3 fields: every field has `w` = 1 and `weightX` = -1. This leads to 1 row and 3 grid cells which would grow and shrink proportionally because `weightX` is automatically set to > 0.
* If the weight of these 3 fields were set to 0.1, 0.1 and 1, the first two fields would adjust the size very slowly and would mostly be as big as a logical grid column (because `w` is set to 1), whereas the third field would adjust its size very fast.


=== Example for WeightY
* A group box with 1 column contains 3 fields: every field has `h` = 1 and `weightY` = -1. This leads to 3 rows with fixed height, no additional space is grabbed, because `weightY` will automatically be set to 0.
* If the weight of these 3 fields were set to 1, the fields would grow and shrink proportionally.
* If the weight of these 3 fields were set to 0.1, 0.1 and 1, the first two fields would adjust the size very slowly and would mostly be a as big as one logical grid row (because `h` is set to 1), whereas the third field would adjust its size very fast.
